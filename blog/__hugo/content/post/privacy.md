# Privacy

# GPS Logging

Did you know that Google tracks where you've been?  
Same as Apple, with their _Find My iPhone_ app.  

**--> Turn off location services when you don't need it**

# RF Jamming

You can create a Faraday's cage for your device by wrapping it in layers of aluminium foil.  
This will stop any radio waves from entering (and leaving)

# Search Enginers

Search engines track you and collect your data.  
Search history, bounce rates, etc - and with these pieces of data they are able to piece together a pretty good image of who you are.

**--> Perhaps try out [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/)**

# SSO / FA / Website Integration

Websites often provide you several ways to log into your account.  

Most commonly, logging in via Facebook, Twitter, GitHub, etc.

But if you care about privacy - you'd realise that you're just giving more companies your data.

**--> Don't log on with Single Sign On, Federated Identity**  

_Also_, Firefox has account containers (could try SessionBox on Chrome) which separate your browser data between sites.

# Private Browsing

Your browser has Incognito / Private Browsing mode, which stops your browser from storing browser history, form data, and cookies.  

**But** it doesn't stop your network administrator, ISP, or possibly even the government from seeing your network traffic.

You could also try using a **Virtual Private Network**, which connects your computer to another network (usually with a different public IP) - which can be used to conceal or even spoof your location.

_But can you trust the VPN?_

There is also _Onion Routing_ / _Tor_, which securely relays your traffic between several nodes.  
This makes tracing network traffic back to you somewhat harder.


_"Trying to conceptualise privacy obscures the full brunt of what privacy really is"_ (paraphrased)
