So about an hour ago, Google's web services for its Google Calendar product went down, and gave users a 'friendly' 404 (/s)

Will post more when we know what's up...

But I'm guessing that during the latest version deployment they had screwed something up and caused the web server to misconfigure...  
Or who knows maybe it's an attack..
