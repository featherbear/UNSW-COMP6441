Leading Causes:
* Oversight and ignorance of small issues - avalanche effect
* Safety fatigue; Less failsafes = better fail-safing
* Workers - Collaboration; shifts; handovers
* Standards - Accountability

Recommendations

1) Training - if you don't know what you're doing, you don't know what you've forgot to do. Drills, procedure

2) Reduce presence of failsafes  
Reduce failsafe fatigue - overconfidence, overcomplication

3) Rehabilitation over Retribution  
Reporting, review

4) Better accounting, reporting, monitoring
Better procedure, stricter review of project, sensoring

Other groups:

* Other ways to stop flow, rather than just cutting
* Testing procedure - simulations
* Communication

* External audits
* Alarm fatigue

Mentor's Ideas:

* Less alarms (Do all of them matter)
* Reduce the penalty for minor infractions (Be comfortable with self reporting)
