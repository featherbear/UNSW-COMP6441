* **Low Probability, High Impact** - An event that has a low chance of occuring, but will have drastic events if it occurs.
* **High Probability, Low Impact** - An event that has a high chance of occuring, but its consequence is often unacknowledged.

Humans are really bad at assessing risks.  
We often overlook risks when we deem that the risk is of a low impact concern.  

> Each risk is, ultimately, an issue that may (undetectably) affect a system. _Do we invest enough time to investigate each risk?_

In truth, the impact of the risk may not be issue, but rather the fact that the risk is _present_.  
The fact that there _exists_ a risk, is really of a higher concern.

We only recognise and respond to low probability risks when that unprobable event, happens
