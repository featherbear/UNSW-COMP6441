# Corruption

Ah, where to start.

Corruption is everywhere.  

There's so many examples of corruption that can be seen in society...  

When a CEO so happens to accidently 'fail to realise' a missing transaction,  
When a minister abets with another party through dishonest means to gain popularity,
And even for us, when we trade honesty and integrity to give us an 'upper hand'

Why does it happen?  
Fame ... greed ... power - all pages in the same book of [self-interest](../weakness-of-the-week-02).

_// Well, there's also data corruption, but that's a different story.//_
