## Capture The Flag

Wrote a CTF server interface that was used in a public CTF event.  
[[github]](https://github.com/featherbear/UNSW-CompClub2019Summer-CTF) [[Kingsway CTF Event]](https://alexpanaman.tumblr.com/post/186017987604/went-to-a-community-ctf-event-recently-the-server)

Also participated in the [SecSoc CTF event](../../secsoc-ctf) on 20/07/2019.

Also participated in the [plsdonthaq.me](../../plsdonthaq.me) CTF challenges on 25/07/2019 - 27/07/2019.  
For these challenges, I created write-ups for questions that I had completed.
