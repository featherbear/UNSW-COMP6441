# Factors of Authentication

* Something you know - ie password  
* Something you have - ie physical element
* Something you are - ie biometrics

_And at the end of the day, the 'physical' information will somehow be transformed into ones and zeros..._

Once your biometric system is compromised, you won't be able to change your fingerprint.
