So this course I'm doing wants me to use Tumblr as a means of blogging.  
Supposedly they want us to use it so they can check the timestamps of each posts - to check if we're posting regularly.

But uhm... you can edit the post dates

That said, what I'll do is write my posts on this Hugo site, then manually post it after on tumblr.

Also, there's a million "Tumblr to Hugo" scripts, but no "Hugo to Tumblr" scripts. Wonder why hmm.. 🤔😏
