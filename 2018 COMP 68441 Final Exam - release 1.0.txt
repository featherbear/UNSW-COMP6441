= COMP6441 and COMP6841 Practice Theory Exam: 2018 =

There is an further prac exam "Part C" for 6841 students only, which will be given at the end of this exam.  6441 students do not sit that exam.  

If you think a question is ambiguous, answer the most likely interpretation and state what you have done.  Where two or more different answers are possible give the answer which best answers the question.  Getting stuck: We suggest you don't spend more than 8 minutes on any of the questions in Part A. Instead move on and come back at the end in any spare time. Keep answers brief and clear. 

There is one bonus mark for following the examination instructions for each paper.

Questions A.1, A.2, A.8 and B.2 will be used to calculate your alternative fall-back mark for the mid-semester exam and have been marked with *MIDSEM FALLBACK QUESTION*.

=== Question A.1 ===
*MIDSEM FALLBACK QUESTION*

The largest of the Yahoo data breaches occurred in late 2013.  According to the latest information which we know about it (based on a public announcement by Yahoo in late 2017) how many user accounts were potentially affected by the breach?

A. 3 billion
B. 1 billion 
C. 100 million
D. 10 million
E. 23 

For this data breach Yahoo reported: "...the stolen user account information may have included names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, hashed passwords (using MD5) and, in some cases, encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers. The investigation indicates that the stolen information did not include passwords in clear text"

However, hackers were able to find many plain text passwords.  A newspaper reporter is interested in how hackers could have found the plaintext passwords if Yahoo only stored hashed passwords and asks you if using MD5 was the problem.  

What would have the impact on the ability of hackers to find plaintext passwords if Yahoo had used a more recent hash algorithm, SHA256, rather than MD5?

A. It would completely solve the problem
B. It would largely, but not entirely, solve the problem
C. It would have a small impact, but the problem would remain largely unsolved
D. It would not be of any help whatsoever

Justify your answer:

=== Question A.2 ===
*MIDSEM FALLBACK QUESTION*

After the breach Yahoo considered transitioned to using the following password hashing scheme, rather than MD5, to hash its users' passwords.

The proposed scheme involved giving each user a public "salt", and then encrypting a standard and publicly known IV using the user's password, and then encrypting that state using the user's salt, and then repeating those two steps over and over again, repeatedly re-encrypting the output of the previous encryption using the same password and the same salt over and over again, 2^n times.

The salt, n, and the final hash output are stored.  The password is not stored.  When users supply a password to be validated the process is repeated for the supplied password and the output of the process is compared with the stored final hash output to see if they match.

Explain the likely purpose of the salt and the large number of repetitions.

=== Question A.7 ===

You are a security engineer consulting to the government, who is alarmed by the 2018 Dimension Data report.  The Office of the Minister for Education tells you that the minister wants to call you in an hour and ask you how seriously she should take the claims in the report that educational institutions are the top targets for cyber-attacks in Australia, why would criminals want to attack educational institutions, and what is the appropriate response for the government to make?

What would you say?  You'll only have 5 minutes on the phone with the minister to respond - so keep it short and clear, and make sure you justify your conclusions and recommendations.

=== Question A.8 ===
*MIDSEM FALLBACK QUESTION*

a) (4 Marks) 
Attached are some pictures of the inside of a cheap 3-disc combination padlock.  Suppose an attacker has a disassembled lock in their possession to study.  They want to manipulate open another (non-disassembled) lock of identical make but with a different 3-digit combination - but they don't know the combination.

Suppose that, like for Master combination padlocks, by putting tension on the shackle you can discover the first number of the combination, and further suppose that the lock automatically makes a sound when all 3 notches line up correctly (i.e. when the combination is correct.)  

If turning the wheel in one smooth motion up to one full revolution is 1 unit of work, estimate how many bits of security the padlock provides.

___ bits of security

=== Question A.9 ===
What you are advised prior to the exam:

This question involves devising a way to effectively and realistically perform social engineering on the UNSW Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Academic).  You must not do anything illegal rude disrespectful or invasive in the real world in preparing for this question, or inconvenience or annoy or alarm him or anyone who works for or with him or knows him.  Most importantly you are not to invade the privacy of his family or personal life in any way.  You are restricted to looking at publicly available information and entirely passive methods.

The exam question:

What is the name of the UNSW Deputy Vice Chancellor (Academic)?
______________________


In the DVC(A)'s office there is a displayed a framed photograph of a group of UNSW students.  Clearly explain a simple and safe social engineering strategy you yourself could follow to find out who is in that photo.

The questions in this part oare worth 25 marks

=== Question B.1 ===
The union and the university have asked you as an independent expert to comment on the security of the online election process they follow for union votes.  

A vote (called a Protected Ballot) is called whenever the union is contemplating a strike - it is the first step needed under law before the union can eventually strike.  In general, the university does not want the union to strike and would always welcome the No votes winning, and the union organisation is keen to be permitted to strike and would always welcome the Yes votes winning.

The software vendor (who also runs the election) explains that their electronic voting system is secret valuable intellectual property and the they will only let you view the source code and/or operation of the system if you sign an extremely restrictive Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) which would then require you to show them in advance anything you might write or say about the system and means that you would require their explicit written consent before you can discuss or publish anything about the system.  There is nothing in the contracts that the union and the university have with the vendor which prevents the vendor from imposing this secrecy requirement on you. 

The only public data about the system you can obtain is an email (reproduced below) sent to a member of the union for the previous protected ballot - advising them of the need to vote and giving instructions on how they do that.

The following question refers to the film "The Towering Inferno" and the city and the time and the situations depicted in the film.

=== Question B.2 ===

The Towering Inferno was made in 68 (4.1 stars on Amazon).  However it demonstrates vulnerabilities still relevent today. 

At the end of the film the Fireman has the following conversation with the Architect:
{{{
	Fireman:

	And I'll keep eating smoke and bringing out bodies...

    ...until somebody asks us...

    ...how to build them.

    Architect:

    Okay. I'm asking.

    Fireman:

    You know where to reach me.

    So long, Architect.

}}}

Suppose you are the Fireman.

The Architect comes to you asking for your advice.  List and briefly justify the main four weaknesses in the design of the tower revealed by the events in the film and make recommendations for how to design safer towers in the future.

=== Question B.2 ===
*MIDSEM FALLBACK QUESTION*

On the Python mailing list Paul Rubin shared code for a general purpose cyptographic library he had written. It generated some discussion. Draft brief responses to the two questions asked below (Edited extract from http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-list/2002-April/100319.html):

{{{

> Use the HMAC construction instead.
}}}

Could you explain the problem here and how it is solved by HMAC?

Do you think [this insecuity] matters in practice, given that this is running
in an interpreted language on a general purpose PC?  Practical attacks probably
involve computer viruses peeking at memory rather than cryptanalysing SHA.
