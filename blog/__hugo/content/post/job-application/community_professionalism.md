# Course Contribution

In the spirit of giving back to the community, alot of my posts have some sort of demo or pseudocode to help students further understand the concepts and ideas.

* All of my lecture notes are publically available.  
[[01]](../../lec01) [[02]](../../lec02) [[03]](../../lec03) [[04]](../../lec04) [[05]](../../lec05) [[06]](../../ ec06) [[07]](../../lec07) [[08]](../../lec08) [[09]](../../lec09) [[10]](../../lec10) [[11]](../../lec11) [[12]](../../lec12) [[13]](../../lec13) [[14]](../../lec14) [[15]](../../lec15) [[16]](../../lec16)

* I released my attempts at the provided practice exam questions.  
[[2015s2-midsem]](../../midsem-2015s2) [[2016s1-midsem]](../../midsem-2016s1) [[2016s1-finals]](../../final-2016s1) 

* Participated in class discussions
  * `(2019-06-05)` [The Deepwater Horizon Accident](../../lab01)
  * `(2019-06-12)` [Harry Houdini](../../reflections02)
  * `(2019-06-19)` [Plane Doors](../../lab03)
  * `(2019-06-26)` [The Secret Facility](../../lab04#case-study)
  * `(2019-07-03)` [Self Driving Cars](../../lab05#case-study-electronic-self-driving-cars)

* Explained and provided a coded example for
  * `(2019-06-06)` Cracking a substitution cipher | [[link]](../../golf-balls)
  * `(2019-06-28)` Hash length extension attacks | [[link]](../../hashes#length-extension-attacks)
  * `(2019-06-28)` Making cracking harder with modulos | [[link]](../../hashes/#making-cracking-harder-with-modulos)
  * `(2019-07-01)` C code vulnerabilities | [[1]](../../whats-wrong-with-the-code-01) [[2]](../../whats-wrong-with-the-code-02) [[3]](../../whats-wrong-with-the-code-03)
  * `(2019-07-09)` SQL code injection | [[link]](../../website-security#sql-injection)
  * `(2019-07-11)` Buffer overflows | [[post]](../../buffer-overflows) [[1]](../../buffer-overflow-01) [[2]](../../buffer-overflow-02) [[3]](../../buffer-overflow-03)

* `(2019-06-18)` Explained and demonstrated how to pick a lock. | [[link]](../../attacking-locks) [[video]](../ptpj5ytlAz1ypltvz_720.mp4)

* `(2019-07-02)` Embedded a [password strength visualiser](../../passwords#try-it-out) into my post about [Password Security](../../passwords#try-it-out).  
This way, people could see a visual representation of how secure their password is that is more meaningful than just "Weak" or "Medium" or "Strong".

* `(2019-07-03)` Presented a [Lightning Talk on HTTP(S) Security](../../lightning-talk-http-https-security) during my lab session.  
After the talk, I wrote a [write-up post](../../lightning-talk-http-https-security) revisiting what I had talked about - so that my peers could read through the article at their own leisure and pace.
