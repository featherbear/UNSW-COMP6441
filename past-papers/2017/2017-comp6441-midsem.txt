There are two marks for following the examination instructions.
You will be supplied working / scribble paper. You must bring your own pens/pencils. You must bring photo ID.
Working is not marked, only your final answer.
Your answers can be submitted by pressing save on this application.
Press Save often to back up your working so far. You may submit your solutions as many times as you like. The last submission ONLY will be marked.
Write your name on the top of each sheet of rough working paper you use, this will not be marked, and write your answers in the computer files as directed in the exam instructions.
You must hand in ALL writing paper at the end of the exam.
Once the exam has commenced you may not leave the exam.
You may only use the viewer and GUI calculator. Other programmes including scripting or interpreted languages may not be used. We are logging all activity and use of other software etc will result in 0 fail. If you are unsure ask the supervisor.
The use of Malachite or social engineering is prohibited. Strict exam conditions apply, including that you may not attempt to communicate with any other person, or access other computers or external data or any internet resources.
If you do not follow these instructions you will get zero marks for the exam and a possible charge of academic misconduct.
Phones must be turned off and not visible, either left outside the room in your bag or sealed in an opaque bag placed under your seat.
If more than one answer to a multiple choice question seems correct then select the answer you think best answers the question.

==== Part A ====
This part is worth 18 marks and consists of 6 three mark questions. Answer all questions. Spend about 3 minutes on each.

=== Question 0 ===
(3 Marks)

What is the most important property for a cryptographic hash function to have to make it as resistant as possible to birthday attacks?

.[A] Preimage resistance
.[B] Collision resistance
.[C] Confidentiality
.[D] Symmetry
.[E] Second-preimage resistance
.[F] Non-determinism


=== Question 1 ===
(3 Marks)

You are a developer of opensource fake-news software called "The trumpet shall sound", or "Trumpet" for short. You wish to use a cryptographic algorithm to generate a 64 character "digital fingerprint" of the "Trumpet" binary, which you will display on your web site so that people can check that they have downloaded a legitimate and unaltered copy of "Trumpet".

What is the most important property for this cryptographic fingerprint algorithm to have?

.[A] Preimage resistance
.[B] Collision resistance
.[C] Confidentiality
.[D] Symmetry
.[E] Second-preimage resistance
.[F] Non-determinism


=== Question 2 ===
(3 Marks)

A MAC is designed to provide
.[A] Neither Integrity nor Authentication
.[B] Authentication but not Integrity
.[C] Integrity but not Authentication
.[D] Integrity and Authentication
.[E] A Very Fashionable Device


=== Question 3 ===
(3 Marks)

You have a password file of 1,000 password hashes. Assuming that 50% of the passwords used were weak passwords which can be found in a dictionary of 1,000,000 common passwords, and that hashing a password takes 12 bits of work on average, roughly how many bits of work would it take to discover all these 500 or so weak passwords?

Note: only enter DIGITS in your answer (or else the automarker will mark it wrong.)
_____


=== Question 4 ===
(3 Marks)

As for Question 3 but now assume that each password is appended to a different 32 bit number (a salt) before the hash was computed, and that the salt number for each password hash is stored, unencrypted, next to the hash in the password file.

Roughly how many bits of work would it take to discover all the 500 or so weak passwords in this case?

Note: only enter DIGITS in your answer (or else the automarker will mark it wrong.)


=== Question 5 ===
(3 Marks)

Below are six lists of expenses submitted by six politicians. Sadly 3 of the politicians are dishonest and submitted made-up fake expense claims, not costs that they really incurred. :(

Suppose we convert letters and other characters into numbers in the range 1..54 using the following table and then separately encipher each of these numbers using RSA with a public encryption key of 23 and a modulus of 55.

For example the plaintext ":)" would be converted into 5,48, and then each of these numbers would be individually encrypted using RSA to produce the cipertext 15,42.

The remainder of this question has been encrypted using RSA with an encryption key of 23 and a modulus of 55.
