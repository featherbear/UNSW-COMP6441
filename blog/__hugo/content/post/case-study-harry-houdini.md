> **Spiritualism**  
&nbsp;  
Spiritualism is the belief that the spirits of the dead have both the ability and the inclination to communicate with the living.  
&nbsp;  
Spiritualism developed and reached its peak growth in membership from the 1840s to the 1920s, especially in English-speaking countries. By 1897, spiritualism was said to have more than eight million followers in the United States and Europe, mostly drawn from the middle and upper classes.  
&nbsp;  
Spiritualism flourished for a half century. Many prominent spiritualists were women. By the late 1880s the credibility of the informal movement had weakened due to accusations of fraud perpetrated by mediums

Houdini was a magic extraordinaire, who dedicated a large portion of his career exposing fradulent spirit whisperers - So-called 'mediums'.

One of the famous mediums whom Houdini had debunked was _Mina Crandon_, nicknamed _Margery_

# TL;DR
* Name: Mina Stinson Crandon
* Period: 1888 - 1941
* Alot of supernatural acts could not be explained, and no conclusive evidence of fraudulence could be discovered.

# A look at [Mediums and Channelers]
Mina was a woman who held strong apt as a medium/channeler. In 1923, her husband (Crandon) encouraged her to attempt contacting the dead.  
Those attempts quickly resulted in great supposed 'successes'.
Crandon, studying at Harvard at the time - kept her demonstrations as a spirit medium private; as not to tar his standing.  
His family though, had decided to contact the Psychology department of the university to launch an investigation into Mina's ability, whom decided that there was something dodgy going on.

`Margery` was the nickname she was given, so as to maintain everyone's social standing and dignity.

So where does _Houdini_ come in to this story?  

When Mina voluntarily became a test subject for observation and proof, Houdini was suspicious and was focused on exposing the supposed fraud. However, his attempts at playing 'dirty' to expose her were, ironically, exposed.

Alot of ... stupidly adequate tests were performed, but each test gave indication that her ability was real. Physical encasement, a mouth full of water, lowkey gagging - and spirits were still able to speak through her. Although still dubious, investigators started becoming seemingly more and more in favour of confirming her abilities. 

...

Houdini of course, in retaliation (and saltiness) publish a paper outlining all of the tricks that were 'used'

On another note, if we took a look at Mina throughout this trial - she was good-willed and quite jovial, perhaps even entertained and excited by fame as a test subject.

Albeit, one piece of evidence - a fingerprint that had matched a local dentist in town - shocked the researchers into believing that maybe everything was just a hoax
