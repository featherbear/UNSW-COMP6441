A root cause analysis is an investigation into an issue, where all events are traced back to the original (root) problem.

* Limited Focus - We only pay attention to what we know. And the things that we know keep drawing our thoughts and minds to those things, instead of looking out for more things.

**Psychological salience** - Focusing on what is most impressive and interesting.

# Heuristics

* Similarity Matching - Creating links between similar events so that future actions can be predicted.
  * Used often in social engineering, as you are able to predict your victim's responses and actions
* Frequency Gambling - Preferring a pattern successfully used in the past than what is more logical for the current context.

* _Bounded rationality_ - Thinking only in the space of what you know (not considering ideas outside of your knowledge/understanding)

* _Group think_ - Thinking and acting for the betterment of a group even if it compromises your own feelings and thoughts.
