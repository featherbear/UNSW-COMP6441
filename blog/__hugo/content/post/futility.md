I recently watched [WarGames](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086567/), and the final segment of the movie was quite intruiging.

> The War Operation Plan Response machine (named "_Joshua_") planned and executed a full-scale assault against the Soviets, and determined that the attack was the best way to "win the game".  

After a confrontation with the purpotedly dead Stephen Falken, we are instilled the idea that just like the game of Tic Tac Toe, some outcomes are futile.  
And as in a nuclear war, it is not a victory, but rather futility - to strike the foe, to then too be decimated in retaliation.

Futility: `pointlessness or uselessness.` _Source: Google_  

It's an interesting concept, especially in light of problem solving.  

Training a computer to recognise the futility of solving a given scenario is one thing,  
but what about ourselves? When do we recognise futility in a situation?

When do we it is time to give up?  
Surely every problem has a solution?
