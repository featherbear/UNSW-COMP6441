When you sit on a chair, how do you know it won't fall?
When you cross a bridge, how do you know that the bridge won't just collapse?

We don't really _know_ that it won't, but given exposure to these things, <s>we end up building trust.</s> _or_ so at least we'd say that; but the real reason is that **it was designed by an engineer**

# Why does engineering work?

What is engineering? According to the Cambridge dictionary, engineering is "_the study of using scientific principles to design and build machines, structures, and other things ..._"

Engineering works because of science - because we apply our understanding of the world, physics, math.

But a definition is just a definition...  

&nbsp;  

I would say... engineeering _works_ because we try.  
We take pride in what we do, because ultimately, what we create is our brainchild - Our showcase to the world, of who we are, and what we have achieved.  
Because we care, we try. And in trying, we pour out our heart and soul into perfecting what we are dveveloping. Not to just create, but to keep on improving. When we reach the end, we see a new goal appear.

It is this never-ending climb to achieve better that makes engineering work, because we try.

# Upon COMP6[48]41
I'm really looking forwards to this course! Although I have experience in so many of these so-called "Security" disciplines; in reality I have only dabbled into the waters.

From this course, I hope to discover which discipline I am most interested in. While it would be nice to be all rounded; my greatest satisfaction would rather be to be the best at a specific area. (Well, ideally; jack of all trades, master of all.)
