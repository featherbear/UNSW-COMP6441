== Total number of marks: 50 ==
== Total duration: 60 minutes ==

There are two marks for following the examination instructions.
Your answers can be submitted by pressing save on this application.
You may submit your solutions as many times as you like. The last submission ONLY will be marked.
Write your name on the top of each sheet of rough working paper you use, this will not be marked, and write your answers in the computer files as directed in the exam instructions.
You must hand in ALL writing paper at the end of the exam.
Once the exam has commenced you may not leave the exam.
You may only use the viewer, GUI calculator, and egrep. Other programmes including scripting or interpreted languages may not be used. We are logging all activity and use of other software etc will result in 0 fail. If you are unsure ask the supervisor.
The use of Malachite or social engineering is prohibited. Strict exam conditions apply, including that you may not attempt to communicate with any other person, or access other computers or external data or any internet resources.
If you do not follow these instructions you will get zero marks for the exam and a possible charge of academic misconduct.
Phones must be turned off and not visible, either left outside the room in your bag or sealed in an opaque bag placed under your seat.

==== Part A ====
This part is worth 24 marks and consists of 12 two mark questions. Answer all questions.

=== Question 0 ===
(2 Marks)
Which of the below best describes the concept of a NONCE?
.[A] A key which is only guessable by brute force
.[B] A number which is not used again
.[C] A random number or phrase
.[D] A salt value for a hash
.[E] An idiot


=== Question 1 ===
(2 Marks)
A canary is designed to protect against which sort of vulnerability?
.[A] Overflow into return address
.[B] Format string vulnerability
.[C] Buffer overflow on heap
.[D] Integer overflow
.[E] All of the above


=== Question 2 ===
(2 Marks)
A MAC is designed to provide
.[A] Neither Confidentiality nor Integrity
.[B] Integrity but not Confidentiality
.[C] Confidentiality but not Integrity
.[D] Confidentiality and Integrity
.[E] An expensive laptop


=== Question 3 ===
(2 Marks)
A MAC is designed to provide
.[A] Neither Non-Repudiation nor Authentication
.[B] Authentication but not Non-Repudiation
.[C] Non-Repudiation but not Authentication
.[D] Non-Repudiation and Authentication
.[E] It's not this one


=== Question 4 ===
(2 Marks)
Remember you are to select the alternative which BEST answers the following question.
The hash of (a message appended to the end of a shared secret) is NOT vulnerable to a length extension attack if
.[A] MD5 is used to perform the hashing
.[B] SHA3 is used to perform the hashing
.[C] SHA1 is used to perform the hashing
.[D] ANY cryptographic hash function is used
.[E] NEVER. Such a hash WILL be vulnerable to a length extension attack regardless of which currently known cryptographic hash function is used.


=== Question 5 ===
(2 Marks)
What is a CRYPTOGRAPHIC random number generator (RNG)?
.[A] A RNG which uses a key
.[B] A RNG whose past outputs do not help you predict the next output
.[C] A RNG whose internal state has at least as many bits as the key space
.[D] A truly random RNG which uses genuine entropy rather than being pseudo random
.[E] A RNG whose outputs are indistinguishable from the output of a collision resistant cryptographic hash function.


=== Question 6 ===
(2 Marks)
Which one of the following letters is not one of the six letters most commonly appearing in written English?
.[A] T
.[B] S
.[C] O
.[D] N
.[E] I
.[E] A


=== Question 7 ===
(2 Marks)
If all of the 100 agents in a system needed to be able to speak with each other confidentially using a symmetric cipher how many distinct keys would be needed?


=== Question 8 ===
(2 Marks)
On average how many hash computations would be required to perform a successful birthday attack on a 16 bit hash?
[Give your answer as the nearest power of two to the number you believe is the correct value. So if you thought the correct value was 42 you would enter 32 as your answer since that is closer to 42 than 64 is.]


=== Question 9 ===
(2 Marks)
You are going to use a system based on Merkle Puzzles to allow other people to communicate with you securely even if you have never met or shared a secret before.
You encode 100,000 messages each using a different 48 bit key.
If someone has a machine capable of encrypting a message in 1 billionth of a second, roughly how many seconds will it take them to select a key to use to communicate with you on average? (give your answer to the nearest power of 2)
Why does encryption time matter for selecting a key?


=== Question 10 ===
(2 Marks)
You are going to use a system based on Merkle Puzzles to allow other people to communicate with you securely even if you have never met or shared a secret before.
You encode 100,000 messages each using a different 48 bit key.
If someone has a machine capable of encrypting a message in 1 billionth of a second, roughly how many seconds will it take them to discover the key someone else is using to communicate with you on average?
(give your answer to the nearest power of 2)


=== Question 11 ===
(2 Marks)
Alice and Bob are using the Diffie-Hellman algorithm to generate a common shared secret. They pick prime 11, and a generator of 2. Alice privately selects 9 and Bob privately selects 4. What is their shared secret?
