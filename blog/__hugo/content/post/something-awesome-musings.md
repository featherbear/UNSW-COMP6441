A major component of this course grade is the "Something Awesome" project.  
Do something, and make it awesome.

I'm not sure what I want to do yet, but here are a few of my ideas:

# RAT (Remote Administration Tool)
Not to be confused with the synonymous Remote Access Trojan malware - which essentially is the same thing but for malicious intent...  

Remote Administration Tools are very useful when it comes to remotely operating my devices, or to even troubleshoot broken computers.  
You've heard of software like TeamViewer, Ammyy and Pulseway. Essentially I'd like to write my own version of these sorts of software - tailored for my use purposes.

# IP-based KVM (Keyboard, Video, Mouse)
Like a software RAT, but hardware based...
The cheapest standlone IP-based KVM unit I've found is the Lantronix Spider, and it's an unpleasant $400+.  
Maybe I could jerry-rig my own...  
I'd need a HDMI/VGA capture capabilities, keyboard and mouse emulation (over USB?), and a remote interface (VNC? RDP? idk?)

Like the [rasky](https://www.nexlab.net/product/rasky/) but affordable :')

# RFID Emulation
Wouldn't it be cool to tap your phone on the Gallagher/Cardax access systems that some universities use to open doors and rooms!  
Or what about emulating a smartcard chip! I think so too!

But I don't think I'm capable of doing this yet...

# Positional Tracking with Radio
A miniature GPS solution. Locate the position of a device in a room!  
There could also be some cool applications to this - like subject movement tracking without the need for a camera.  
_Imagine having a spotlight that follows you :D_
