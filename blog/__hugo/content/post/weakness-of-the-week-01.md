# Changing your frame of mind

It's often hard to enter a new way of thought.  
Humans love familiarity: rhythm, pattern, order. We enjoy residing in a bubble of comfort. Accustomed to the buzzing streets of the city, the starry night skies, the everyday routine that we find ourselves in.

But this enjoyment of safety, it leads to human complacency.  
We drown ourselves in the normal, and lose sensitivity and awareness of the world around us.

We stop caring as much, and take things for granted.

The loud shouts of warnings, turn into quiescent whispers.  
We can forget that sometimes we are in danger.

* How do you act in a crisis?
* Try to listen to a new genre of music.
* Sit in a new seat
