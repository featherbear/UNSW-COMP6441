A bug is a flaw in a program code that could possibly lead to security issues.

Bug bounties are a way for companies to encourage the public (with a financial reward) to find and report issues so that the vulnerabiliites can be fixed.

# Scope

Companies often have a scope of vulnerabilities that they wish for you to investigate.  
They would also have a list of things which they would not want for you to explore.

# Process

* Find a suitable program
* Review the scape
* Find target
* Hit the target 
* Write a report
* Submit the report

# One of the tools, Fuzzing

Mutation based - generation based


Using AFL (mutation based)...

* bit flip
* byte flip
* arithmetics
* havoc
* trim
