# Moral Hazards

> "I donno wat I stay doing. Cuz, eh, I no do da tings I like do. I do da tings dat I no like." - Pidgin

Excuse the echolalia and polemics, but mind over matter.  

It is 'easy' to follow rules and procedures when the actions we take hold no effect on our lives.  

Jot a few things down, sign some things here, mash some keys there...  
**Work finishes for the day and we carry on our own merry way**.  

_But when the stakes go up..._  
Possible consequences start to violate our eupathy, invading our personal bubble of serenity.  
We start to lock up.  
We know what we need to do, but we cannot bring ourselves to do it.

It's like trying to face your fears. We're scared and hesistant.  
But what's worse than overcoming a fear is overcoming our morals...  
_... is it **even** something that you should overcome?_

Breaking through a fear, it is reaching that light at the end of the tunnel.  
But breaking through a moral iconoclasm, it is a decurrent feeling that insculpts your mind...  
**Work finishes for the day, but - still you're stuck on the pages from today**.

Beneath our blood and bones, we all have some sort of moral perception.  
Activities that steer away from those feelings - or if near, aligned with those beliefs - We're fine.  
But perhaps if the fate of another's life held at gunpoint by your own barren hands - Things that we are not okay with, we falter.

Perhaps in protecting ourselves we harm others.

They say _"don't light yourself on fire to keep others warm"_,  
but surely you shouldn't light others on fire to keep yourself warm, right?
