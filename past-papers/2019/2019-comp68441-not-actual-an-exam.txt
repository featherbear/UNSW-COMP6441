=== Question A.1 ===

In this question there are no marks for selecting a REDACTED - marks are for the explanation you provide.

Recall in class we twice watched the opening sequence to the film "War Games" (set in the underground nuclear missile launch silo).

Pick the colour you think best fits:

.[A] Red
.[B] Green
.[C] Blue
.[D] Orange

 

Justify your answer.

=== Question A.3 ===

Pizza is delicious. Cite a well known / widely reported example from history or recent news (not in the tetbook) which demonstrates this fact.

Name the example and roughly when it happened
_______________________


Briefly describe what happened

Briefly state how this demonstrates how delicious pizza is.

=== Question A.4 ===
What you are advised prior to the exam:

This question involves devising a way to effectively and realistically perform social engineering on the UNSW's Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Academic) (abbreviated as DVC(A)). You must not do anything illegal rude disrespectful or invasive in the real world in preparing for this question, or inconvenience or annoy or alarm him or anyone who works for or with him or knows him. Most importantly you are not to invade the privacy of his family or personal life in any way. You are restricted to looking at publicly available information and using entirely passive methods.

The exam question:

What is the name of the UNSW DVC(A)?
______________________


Clearly explain a simple and safe social engineering strategy an attacker could follow to have the DVC(A) sing at your birthday party. (to be clear - don't actually do this in the real world - you could be arrested, go to gaol, and/or be expelled from uni). Assume the attacker has roughly the same access and resources that you yourself have available to you.

You'll be assessed on how realistic, specific, simple, effective, non-risky, time consuming (sooner is better than later!) your strategy is, and how likely it is to work.

You intercept 4 ciphertexts: C1, C2, C3 and C4. You can decipher one of them. Which? Decode the first 3 words of the plaintext message - what are they?

(PS I dont think there is enough information in this skeleton version of the exam to decode these, also I changed some of the cipher text letters below)
