[Lecture 4](https://featherbear.github.io/UNSW-COMP6441/blog/post/lec04/#type-1-and-type-2-errors) introduced Type I and Type II errors.

|Type|Prediction|Reality|
|:------|:--------:|:-----:|
|False positive (one)|Y|N|
|False negative (two)|N|Y|

Type 1 errors are known as false positives, and occur when an outcome is incorrectly predicted as being true, when in reality it is false.

Type 2 errors are known as false negatives, and occur when an outcome is incorrectly predicted as being false, when in reality it is true.

# Why?

_Why do these errors exist?_  

I guess these issues are inevitable.  
When we assume the outcome of a situation, it is what it is, an _assumption_.  

When we favour an outcome over another, it is because we have a greater belief in the possibility of that outcome. A possibility.


# Which?

_If we had to live with one of these errors, which would you prefer?_  

It's a hard question to answer, and it depends on the situation of the event.

Would you rather have false hope in something amazing, or to experience a nightmare, but wake up realising that everything is all good.

Probably you would rather experience the second outcome - but it isn't always the case.
