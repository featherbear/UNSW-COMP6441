 = COMP6[84]41 Midsemester Exam : 2019t2 =
== Total number of marks: 55 ==
== Total duration: 55 minutes + 5 minutes reading time ==

This is a closed book exam.  The class textbook is not provided for this exam.

There is one mark for following the examination instructions.

A result of 50 marks will be scaled to be full marks so you can skip 5 marks worth of questions in part A and still get full marks.  I suggest you skip the final question in part A if you are tight for time as part B is worth much more.

Your answers can be submitted by pressing save on this application.

You may submit your solutions as many times as you like. The last submission ONLY will be marked.

Write your name and student number on the top of each sheet of any rough working paper you use, this will not be marked, and write your answers in the computer files as directed in the exam instructions.

You must hand in ALL writing paper at the end of the exam.

Once the exam has commenced you may not leave the exam.

You may only use the viewer, GUI calculator, and the decoding app supplied for the last question. Other programs including scripting or interpreted languages may not be used.  We are logging all activity and use of other software etc will result in 0 fail.  If you are unsure ask the supervisor.

If no answer seems perfect, or if more than one answer seems correct then give the answer which you think best answers the question.

The use of top men, misdirection, or social engineering is prohibited.  Strict exam conditions apply, including that you may not attempt to communicate with any other person, or access other computers or external data/information or any internet resources.

If you do not follow these instructions you will get zero marks for the exam and a possible zero marks for the course or a charge of academic misconduct.

Phones must be turned off and not visible, either left outside the room in your bag or sealed in an opaque bag placed under your seat.

==== Part A ====

This part is worth 39 marks and consists of 13x3 mark questions.

=== Question 0 ===
(3 Marks)

You are setting password policy for your company.  What is the best policy according to NIST?

 .[A] Users must change password every 6 months
 .[B] Require passwords to satisfy structural rules such as "at least one uppercase letter, one digit, and one non-alphanumeric symbol"
 .[C] Passwords must not be on a blacklist of common passwords
 .[D] Passwords must be of a minimum length
 .[E] Use a set of personal questions as challenges rather than passwords eg "What was the name of your first teacher"
 .[F] Generate the password randomly for the user and don't allow them to change it.


=== Question 1 ===
(3 Marks)

The modulus of a particular RSA key is generated by multiplying two different prime numbers, each having a length of 20 decimal digits (there are about 2x10^18 such primes).  The modulus is public, the two primes which produced it are secret.  If an attacker can ever find the two prime factors they can find the private key, and so break the code.

If it takes 8 bits of work to test if one number divides into another how many bits of work would it take on average to brute force one of the two factors of the modulus by repeated trial divisions?


 .[A] 0-19 bits of work
 .[B] 20-29 bits of work
 .[C] 30-39 bits of work
 .[D] 40-49 bits of work
 .[E] 50-59 bits of work
 .[F] 60-69 bits of work
 .[G] 70-79 bits of work
 .[H] 80 or more bits of work


=== Question 2 ===
(3 Marks)

In a hypothetical electronic voting system the candidate names are
"Putin", "Trump", "Xi", "Ahern", "Johnson", "Duterte" and "Trudeau".
Candidates vote by encrypting their selected candidate's name, and
posting the resulting encrypted candidate name on a public bulletin
board which is tamper evident.  The ID of the voter is shown
alongside their encrypted vote on the bulletin board so everyone can
check that no one voted twice, and that only eligible voters voted.

Assume that electoral officials can be safely trusted. For each of the following encryption schemes state whether or not it could safely be used to encrypt the candidate
names in order to ensure that no candidate can view the bulletin board and learn
who did, or who didn't, vote for them.

Vignere Cipher (each individual voter has a unique key also known to electoral officials)
 .[Yes] Safe to use
 .[No] Not safe to use

2048 bit RSA (encrypted using a publicly known public key, only the electoral officials know the private key)
 .[Yes] Safe to use
 .[No] Not safe to use

AES 256 (each individual voter has a unique key also known to electoral officials)
 .[Yes] Safe to use
 .[No] Not safe to use

One Time Pad (each individual voter has a unique key also known to electoral officials)
 .[Yes] Safe to use
 .[No] Not safe to use



=== Question 3 ===
(3 Marks)

You include your favorite quote using METHOD A and include the cipher text at the end of a long email to your friend - and then you encrypt the whole email using METHOD B before you send it.  So the quote has been encrypted twice.

Roughly how much work will it take to find the decryption of the quote if it takes 30 bits of work to decrypt METHOD A and if it takes 30 bits of work to decrypt METHOD B?

 .[A] 30 bits
 .[B] 60 bits
 .[C] 90 bits
 .[D] 900 bits
 .[E] A good quote by Goethe is "You can easily judge the character of a person by how they treat those who can do nothing for them" - however it's not the one you encrypted.


=== Question 4 ===
(3 Marks)

The following question relates to the Houdini case study done in your analysis group.

The object of the case study was to devise a protocol for Bess to follow.  What are the two most important properties the protocol needed to have?

Most important property (use between 4 and 20 characters in your answer)
(hint: it is one of the CIA properties)
_________________


Second most important property (use between 4 and 20 characters in your answer)
(no hints for this one)

Second preimage: 2^ ______ hashes

Collision:  2^ _____ hashes


=== Question 10 ===
(3 Marks)

Lachlan and I are going to use going to use Merkle Puzzles to securely discuss the exam questions the day before the exam runs (because he loves Merkle puzzles).  I'll send him 10,000 encrypted mini-messages of the form:

{{{
   This is puzzle seventeen, the key is jhgrtdctrq

   and

   This is puzzle eighteen, the key is pojygvcxdw
}}}

What cipher would be best to use to encrypt the mini-messages?

.[A] One Time Pad
.[B] Ceasar
.[C] Vigenere
.[D] RSA 512 bit modulus
.[E] RSA 2048 bit modulus
.[F] AES 256


=== Question 11 ===
(3 Marks)

A confident sounding comment about passwords posted on the internet:
{{{
 I’ve moved to using three word passphrases that use Subject->Action->Object format.
 They need not be sensible though. Things like:

    Obama Punting Cornflakes

   or

    Grandma Curling Pumpkins

 Both of those are over 80 bits, and you’ll never forget them. In fact, if you read this, you’ll never get the image of Obama punting a box of cornflakes out of your head."

 - Jonathan Beerhalter 2012-03-08
}}}

Most people have a vocabulary of between 20,000 and 40,000 words that they use or can recognise.

Assume that the three words in each passphrase are randomly chosen from three dictionaries of 10,000 familiar words each (one of Subject words, one of Action words, one of Object words) and are written separated by a space, first letter uppercase, remaining letters lowercase, and that it takes one bit of work to test one passphrase.

How many bits of work would it take on average to break one of Jonathan's passphrases?


.[A] Around 40 bits
.[B] Around 50 bits
.[C] Around 60 bits
.[D] Around 70 bits
.[E] Around 80 bits
.[F] Around 90 bits
.[G] Around 100 bits or more


=== Question 12 ===
(3 Marks)

I suggest you don't do this question until and unless you have finished Part B below - it is probably not worth it.  Remember you can skip 5 marks in Part A and still get full marks.

The ciphertext below has been produced by a Vignere cipher.

==== Part B ====

This part is worth 15 Marks and consists of one question.

=== Question 13 ===
(15 Marks)

Decode the ciphertxt in the NSA app (which is a tab in your web browser).  If you close it by mistake you can reopen it by right clicking on the desktop or ask the exam supervisor for help.

The message has been enciphered using a monoalphabetic substitution cipher.

Write the deciphered plaintext below, use ? symbols for undecrypted letters, partial marks for partial decryptions so long as it is clear.
