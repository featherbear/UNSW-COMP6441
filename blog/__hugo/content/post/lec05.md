# The is-ought problem

> Also known as Hume's Guillotine.

This philosophical problem considers the implication that knowledge of how things are currently happening do not necessarily imply how the future would be

At times, the risk is more important than the outcome itself.  
Our lecturer gave us an example, of a _terrible_ story where a lady reversed too quickly from the driveway.  

Alot of us - myself inclusive - expected to hear a terrible accident story.  
But that's the thing, just like that, I had overlooked the issue at hand - the fact that the lady reversed too quickly.

The issue isn't whether or not she hit someone.  
The issue is that she had reversed too quickly.

And we had overlooked it.
