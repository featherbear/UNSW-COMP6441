I stayed at home instead of going to my tutorial because I was abit stressed out and underprepared for the two exams I had the day after :( - Luckily I steal everyone's notes and synthesise it!!!

> Question: If we went to cyberwar with a world superpower, what would be the main risks and what would we do to prevent and/or prepare for them?

# Risks

* Insider attack
* Ransomware attacks on infrastructure
* DoS attacks (eg cutting undersea cables???)
* Sabotaging power and other services
* Backdooring software and logging/surveiling
* Attacks on warfare (eg. hijack drones, nukes?)
* Jamming signals (a form of DoS)
* Data theft (eg. stealing company/military secrets)
* Denial of tech gear (hardware) from enemy?

# Big list of recommendations

* Compartmentalise knowledge of intelligence
* Background checks on programmers - risks Type I/Type II errors
* Keep critical people anonymous - may be hard to implement (esp in democratic system where leader is important to identify)
* Create backdoors in other nation's software/hardware to exploit in case of war - what if found early?
* Create rootkit/malware to attack/monitor enemies and possibly attack if it detects them attacking - possible Type I/Type II errors
* Limit/remove internet access to prevent cyberattack - feasible?
* Create nationwide intranet
* Prepare financial resources for cyberwar
* Use locally-sourced applications (especially corporate, but civilians too)
* In event of DoS/DDoS, have redundancy for online services (prevents single point of failure/single target of attack)
* Background checks on employees who have influence (eg. corporate, military)
* International wargames for preparation and training
* Hardware backdoor for drones (etc) to disable if hijacked
* Audit infrastructure

# Analysis

If I were asked this question, the risks I would immediately identify would have been **denial of service attacks** and **sabotaging of infrastructure**. Good to see that those ideas appeared in my class' discussion.

I would posit these two risks (especially the latter) as having a very impact - By damaging infrastructure (whether that be supply, transport or communications) it causes a large disruption within the nation, weakening the country's capacity to concentrate on the larger issues.

The risks identified in class seem to all collate into four groups: _DoS_, _Surveillance_ and _Espionage_

_How would we respond to these risks?_

> Create rootkit/malware to attack/monitor enemies and possibly attack if it detects them attacking - possible Type I/Type II errors.

Very debatable - Essentially a recommendation to fight fire with fire.  
If watching [WarGames](../futility) has taught me anything - it's that no one wins a nuclear war. Sure tracking and surveillance isn't "nuclear" but such a violation of privacy would probably entail a retaliation.

> Limit/remove internet access to prevent cyberattack - feasible?  
> Create nationwide intranet

Give me a `c`, C!  
Give me an `e`, E!  
Give me an `n`, N!  
Give me an `s`, S!  
Give me an `o-r-s-h-i-p`, {...}  

What does it spell?? A futile attempt to restrict information!  

With Tor, Proxies, VPNs, [DNS over HTTPS](../security-everywhere-dns-over-https), and all sorts of methods to work around censorship tactics - such an effort is really a waste of both the government, and our time. 'If there's a will there's a way' (not to say that everything is futile though...)

> Prepare financial resources for cyberwar

This, I agree with. **Not only** financial resources, but also training people to be security professionals, and for people to truly understand the state of security that we have!
